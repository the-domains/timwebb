<article style=""><h1>Tim Webb - Auckland Real Estate Agent - Wallace &amp; Stratton</h1><p>Now More Than Ever, You Need An Agent Who Can Cut Through The Marketing Noise, &amp; Get Your Home Top Of Mind In The Real Estate Market.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0d0b97451d3e061f680f319c69275d2dc66c3666.jpg" /></article>

There was a time when Real Estate agents showed up to your house, asked you to sign their agency agreement, put a sign in the front yard, showed a few people through, gave out a few brochures, and with any luck, sold your property.

Those days are gone.

Now, it's about "Showtime" ... giving your audience what they want, and leaving them wanting more.

More specifically, how your agent prepares, presents and showcases your home, along with increasing "value perception" by creating an eye-catching advantage over the competition, and the ability to almost instantly attract and engage an audience of buyers, already "pre-sold" on your property.

Did you know that without exception, every buyer is seeking their dream, their vision, their story ... their own unique and special place to call home? This is why I believe your home should always be showcased and promoted to convey more than just "3 bedrooms, a lounge, dining room and kitchen".

Buyers are seeking their new home, not a new house.

Making this connection part of any buyer's reality is very much to your advantage when marketing your property, because perception is reality. Creating an emotional connection manifests strong emotional desire, and this has the power to dramatically increase the "value perception" each buyer interprets and pays, for your home.

Remember, first impressions are lasting impressions. The quality of marketing your agent puts forward largely determines the quality of buyer you attract, how long your property sits on the market, and more importantly, the price you acheive.

Do you want a proven performer who prepares, presents and showcases your home, who can acquire on cue, an audience of emotionally engaged, "pre-sold" buyers who want to pay you more, or an agent who advertises your house as 4 walls, a floor, ceiling and roof?
